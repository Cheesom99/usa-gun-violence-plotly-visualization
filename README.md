## This is a personal project of mine, learning how to use plotly.
## This project is for the development of a web interactive dashboard.
## The dashboard shows a barplot of the average number of kills or injury and a choropleth map of the number of kills and injury for every year.
## The user of the dashboard has to pick the year and the if to view kills or injuries.
